```

## Quick Queries (no full rescan)
```bash
loct query who-imports <file>     # files that import target
loct query where-symbol <name>    # find symbol definitions

loct find --similar <Name>        # avoid dup components
```

## Refactors / Impact
```bash
loct slice <file> --consumers --json   # dependent context
loct find --impact <file>              # what breaks if removed
loct cycles                            # circular imports (lazy imports tagged as info)

```

## Compare branches/commits

loct diff --since main|HEAD~N
```
