# loctree v0.5.9 — AI Agent Quick Reference

> You have access to loctree for codebase analysis.
> Use these commands BEFORE reading files manually or grepping.

**Scan once, slice many.** Capture structure, extract focused context.

## Install & Scan
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loctree/Loctree/main/tools/install.sh | sh
loct             # creates .loctree/ with snapshot + reports
```

## Quick Queries (no full scan needed)
```bash
loct query who-imports <file>     # files that import target
loct query where-symbol <name>    # find symbol definitions
loct query component-of <file>    # graph component containing file
```

## Before creating new components
```bash
loct find --similar <Name>        # find similar (avoid duplicates)
loct query where-symbol <Name>    # check if exists
```

## Before refactoring
```bash
loct slice <file> --consumers --json  # what depends on it
loct find --impact <file>             # what breaks if removed
loct cycles                           # detect import cycles
```

## Compare branches/commits
```bash
loct diff --since main            # compare against main branch
loct diff --since HEAD~5          # delta since 5 commits ago
```

## Dead code detection
```bash
loct dead --confidence high       # unused exports (safe to remove)
```

## Focused AI context
```bash
loct slice <file> --consumers --json | claude
loct --for-ai                     # project overview JSON
```

## Tauri FE<>BE coverage
```bash
loct commands --missing           # FE calls without BE handlers
loct commands --unused            # BE handlers without FE calls
loct trace <handler>              # investigate handler usage
```

## CI pipeline checks
```bash
loct lint --fail --sarif > results.sarif
```

## IDE Integration
```
loctree://open?f=<file>&l=<line>  # clickable URLs in SARIF output
```
