> You have access to loctree for codebase analysis.
> Use these commands BEFORE reading files manually or grepping.

**Scan once, slice many.** Capture structure, extract focused context.

## Install & Scan
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loctree/Loctree/main/tools/install.sh | sh
loct             # creates .loctree/snapshot.json
```

## Before creating new components
```bash
loct find <Name>            # find similar/symbols (avoid duplicates)
```

## Before refactoring
```bash
loct slice <file> --consumers     # what depends on it
loct report --impact <file>       # what breaks if removed
loct cycles                       # detect import cycles
```

## Dead code detection
```bash
loct dead --confidence high       # unused exports
loct report --entrypoints         # main/script entry points
```

## Focused AI context
```bash
loct slice <file> --consumers --json | claude
loct --for-ai                     # project overview JSON
```

## Tauri FE<>BE coverage
```bash
loct report --preset-tauri src src-tauri/src
loct trace <handler>              # investigate handler usage
```

## CI pipeline checks
```bash
loct report --fail-on-missing-handlers  # FE->BE integrity
loct report --fail-on-ghost-events      # unused events
loct report --sarif > results.sarif     # SARIF output
```
