**Scan once, slice many.** Capture structure, extract focused context.

## Install & Scan
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loctree/Loctree/main/tools/install.sh | sh
loctree          # creates .loctree/snapshot.json
```

## Before creating new components
```bash
loctree -A --check <Name>   # find similar (avoids duplicates)
loctree -A --symbol <Name>  # find symbol definitions & usage
```

## Before refactoring
```bash
loctree slice <file> --consumers  # what depends on it
loctree -A --impact <file>        # what breaks if removed
loctree -A --circular             # detect import cycles
```

## Dead code detection
```bash
loctree -A --dead                 # unused exports
loctree -A --entrypoints          # main/script entry points
```

## Focused AI context
```bash
loctree slice <file> --consumers --json | claude
loctree --for-ai                  # project overview JSON
```

## Tauri FE<>BE coverage
```bash
loctree -A --preset-tauri src src-tauri/src
loctree trace <handler>           # investigate handler usage
```

## CI pipeline checks
```bash
loctree -A --fail-on-missing-handlers   # FE->BE integrity
loctree -A --fail-on-ghost-events       # unused events
loctree -A --sarif > results.sarif      # SARIF output
```
